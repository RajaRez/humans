# Humans

Continually reduced to knowing without feeling  
inorganic sublimity, blurred edges and hard corners  
sharp tears through the fabric of interwoven hearts  
Californian fields  
required for entry,  
representation diss-emanated by proxy,
and no harvest but the lament of cracked hands
broken backs, torn families, and a reality 
growing ever more distant.
Do you remember how to identify
trees, trucks, bikes
loose ends?
Theyâ€™re still there, tied behind your back.
Ancient and forgetful, operating
language
unreadable
but
clear, followable.
For the last, becoming the first:
we put in whatever we
remember
even if it
is just close enough
to know
now
that the light is not the sun
and the light is not the sky
and the light is not the gods
who can't save you, don't want to
who can't even see you
through the density
of our collection.
Dark matter and energies distance galaxies:
it is the same with people in societies these days.
As one we conflate
sometimes many for a few
and other times
too specific
close to home, but not
a waste-land, cold
sheets, ever strangling these hearts,
once warmed by the rapture of a more open embrace.
